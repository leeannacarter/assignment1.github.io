## Python Agent Model

Leeanna has programmed an agent base model which autonomize actions and interactions between agents within a static environment. For instance, a hypothetical scenario of modelling animal presence and interations within a farm depicts the framework of an agent base model. Basic python syntax's have been implemented to create object orientated procedures to construct the agent model. The agent base model contains 10 ageents that interact with one another, eat and move randomly within its environment space accordingly to the python implemented syntax's. Thus, the outcome created models 10 agents moving randomly 100 times within a 255x255 size square grid, simutaneously eating part of the environment away and maintaning an average distance from each other (if within 20 units away).

The below objects were used to finalize the model.
