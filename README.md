## Python Agent Model

Leeanna has created an agent base model programme which autonomise actions and interactions of agents within a static environment. For instance, a hypothetical scenario of modelling animal presence and interations within a farm depicts the framework of an agent base modelling. The Agent base model contains 10 ageents that interact with one another, eat and move randomly within its environment space accordingly to python syntax's. Basic python sntaxs have been used to create object orientated procedures to construct the agent model.
Sytax created within the agents are established in the below table. Thus, the outcome created models 10 agents moving randomly 100 times within a 255x255 size square grid, simutaneously eating part of the environment away and maintaning an average distance from each other (if within 20 units away), thus iteracting with one anthoer to prevent such case.
