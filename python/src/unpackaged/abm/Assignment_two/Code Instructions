To run the bacteria_bomb.py script, an integrated development environment (IDE) is needed, therefore, Anaconda python package is recommended to be installed.
Save all the files from the Assignment_two folder into a folder on the desktop.
Access the command prompt from the windows explorer search bar (Window's user) or terminal (MAC users) and type in spyder followed by the enter key.
Open bacteria_bomb.py file within spyder.
Run the code by selecting the run button from the run tab or the green arrow icon (7th icon from the start).
Once ran, the model should produce a 300 by 300 graph presenting the density of the 5000 bacterial agents y and z location.
